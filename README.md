# Introduction to Survival Analysis using R - PBC Dataset
 
The goal of the analysis is to use some methods namely: Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator, Log-Rank Test, Cox Proportional Hazard, Machine Learning, and Cross-Validation, to assess the benefit of some selected covariates on survival.
The basic analysis, that I will do, can be done using PBC dataset and the functions in R package "survival", alongside some other packages.
